      <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
      <div class="half-width">
        <p>My love of storytelling led me, in a roundabout way, to web development. I graduated with an MFA in Creative Writing and worked as a college writing instructor. I started to code as a hobby. I loved it so much that I decided to go through an immersive program with over 500 hours of instruction in three months. I discovered, then, that writing code is similar to writing poetry. It needs to have the most impact in the fewest lines. It creates an experience for the user. It tells a story.</p>

      <div class="half-width">
        <p>I love working on the front-end because it’s where code meets creativity. It’s where my experience teaching digital rhetoric helps me understand how to take an idea and build it into a useful feature through JavaScript, CSS, and some good ol’ HTML. I love learning new frameworks like Angular or React and figuring out challenges with my research skills. I also continue to practice building full stack apps with clean code—and lots of coffee.</p>
