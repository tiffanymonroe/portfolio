          On a completely nondescript day, exhausted, I got on a busy Southern California freeway headed West, instead of East. I was on my way to the wrong campus.
        </p>

        <p class="blog">
          I'm actually a little surprised it didn't happen earlier. I was teaching on three campuses in different parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties. I had spent a little over a decade in academia, from student to university instructor. Adjuncting, as it's called, has become the way of life for those of us who wanted to teach at the college or university level. But I couldn't do it anymore.
        </p>

        <p class="blog">
          I'd taught myself HTML right out of high school. I learned CSS, a little JavaScript and Ruby later, and I loved it. As much as I loved teaching, I knew I needed a change and I knew I wanted to be a developer.
        </p>

        <p class="blog">
          I got my first freelance job through a fellow writing instructor. I redesigned an <a href="http://tiffanymonroe.com/dirtcakes/">online literary magazine</a>, wrote some simple code, and was excited to see it go live. The editor-in-chief decided to put the magazine on the back-burner. Still, I was extremely proud of what I'd accomplished with a few tech skills.
        </p>

        <p class="blog">
          So here I am fresh out of <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">code school</a>, looking for freelance jobs. Luckily, I found Toptal through <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2014/10/10/sites-finding-remote-work/">Skillcrush</a>, where I learned those first few tech skills. I love that Toptal "looks for great problem solvers with passion and drive" because, hey, that's me! Freelance work appeals to me because it's a lot like being an adjunct. There's freedom in it. Though, thankfully, minus the drive.
